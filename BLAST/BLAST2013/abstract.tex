Abstract: 

A longstanding open problem in universal algebra is to characterize those
lattices that are isomorphic to congruence lattices of finite algebras.  
We call such lattices "representable."

In this talk we discuss the project of cataloging all small lattices that are
known to be representable, and give an overview of the known methods for
constructing finite algebras with a given congruence lattice.  These include a
relatively new method involving "overalgebras," which are built by gluing
together smaller algebras, as well as an older approach called "the closure
method."

The closure method has been extremely useful for identifying many small
congruence lattices, and we show pictures of all examples known to us. However,
existing algorithms can only identify congruence lattices of algebras with very
small universes (say, 9 or 10 elements). We demonstrate a new fast closure
algorithm, based on choosing an optimal subdirect decomposition, that allows us
to identify congruence lattices on much larger sets than was previously
possible.
