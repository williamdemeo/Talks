\begin{theorem}
{Lucchini, 1994} There exist intervals $M_n$ in subgroup lattices
of finite groups with
\[
n = q + 2 \qquad \text{ or } \qquad n =
\frac{q^t + 1}{q + 1}+ 1,\]
where $q$ is a prime power and $t$ is an odd prime.
\end{theorem}
At present the smallest cases for which no occurrence of $M_n$ is known are $n = 16,
23, 35, \dots$.
