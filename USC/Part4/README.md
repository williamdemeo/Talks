**Abstract:**
A long-standing open problem in universal algebra is to characterize those
lattices that are isomorphic to congruence lattices of finite algebras. This
week, I will conclude this series of lectures on this topic by discussing in
greater detail our new method for expanding and extending a finite algebra so
that its congruence lattice grows in predictable ways. In particular, I will
prove two basic theorems about such expansions, and demonstrate these results
with some examples using the Universal Algebra Calculator.
