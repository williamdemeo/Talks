**Abstract:**
A long-standing open problem in universal algebra is to characterize those
lattices that are isomorphic to congruence lattices of finite algebras. Until
this problem is resolved, our understanding of finite algebras is incomplete,
since, given an arbitrary finite algebra, we cannot say whether there are a
priori restrictions on the shape of its congruence lattice. If we find a finite
lattice that does not occur as the congruence lattice of a finite algebra (as
many suspect we will), then we can finally say that such restrictions exist. It
has been shown that this problem is equivalent to the problem of characterizing
those lattices that are intervals in subgroup lattices of finite groups. In this
week's seminar, I will provide more background on both versions of the problem,
and then describe some new approaches and recent progress.
