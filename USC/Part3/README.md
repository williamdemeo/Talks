**Abstract:**
A long-standing open problem in universal algebra is to characterize those
lattices that are isomorphic to congruence lattices of fi nite algebras. It has
been shown that this problem is equivalent to the problem of characterizing
those lattices that are intervals in subgroup lattices of finite groups. In the
last two meetings, I gave an overview of some of our new results related to this
problem. Specifically, we discussed ways to expand and extend a finite algebra
so that its congruence lattice grows in predictable ways. We also discussed
"interval enforceable" properties of finite groups and how they might help us
solve the main problem. In this week's seminar, I will discuss these topics in
greater detail and supply proofs of many of the claims I've made in our previous
two meetings.
