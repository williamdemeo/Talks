USC -- Algebra and Logic Seminar -- Fall 2012
=============================================

In the Algebra and Logic Seminar at University of South Carolina, I gave a
series of four talks about methods of representing finite lattices as 
congruence lattices of finite algebras.  This respository contains the slides
I used for these lectures.
