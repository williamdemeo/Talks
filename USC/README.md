USC Algebra and Logic Seminar, Fall 2012
========================================

In the Algebra and Logic Seminar at University of South Carolina, I gave a
series of four talks about methods of representing finite lattices as 
congruence lattices of finite algebras.  This respository contains the slides
I used for these lectures.

## Part 1: Sep 21, 2012  

**Title:** The Finite Lattice Representation Problem and intervals in Sugroup
  Lattices of Finite Groups: Part i.

**Speaker:** William DeMeo

**Session:** Algebra and Logic Seminar

**Location:**  
Department of Mathematics  
University of South Carolina  
LeConte College, Room 312

**Date:** Friday Sep 21, 3:30--4:30 PM

**Abstract:**
A long-standing open problem in universal algebra is to characterize those
lattices that are isomorphic to congruence lattices of finite algebras. Until
this problem is resolved, our understanding of finite algebras is incomplete,
since, given an arbitrary finite algebra, we cannot say whether there are a
priori restrictions on the shape of its congruence lattice. If we find a finite
lattice that does not occur as the congruence lattice of a finite algebra (as
many suspect we will), then we can finally say that such restrictions exist. It
has been shown that this problem is equivalent to the problem of characterizing
those lattices that are intervals in subgroup lattices of finite groups. In this
week's seminar, I will provide more background on both versions of the problem,
and then describe some new approaches and recent progress.

## Part 2: Sep 28, 2012  

**Title:** The Finite Lattice Representation Problem: Part ii.

**Speaker:** William DeMeo

**Session:** Algebra and Logic Seminar

**Location:**  
Department of Mathematics  
University of South Carolina  
LeConte College, Room 312

**Date:** Friday Sep 28, 3:30--4:30 PM

**Abstract:**
A long-standing open question in universal algebra asks whether
every finite lattice is isomorphic to the congruence lattice of a finite
algebra. Last week we discussed a range of well known methods for constructing a
finite algebra with a given congruence lattice. In this week's seminar I will
describe some new procedures for expanding and extending a finite algebra so
that its congruence lattice changes in predictable ways. To demonstrate the
approach, I'll provide some concrete examples using GAP and the Universal
Algebra Calculator.

## Part 3: Oct 5, 2012  

**Title:** The Finite Lattice Representation Problem: Part iii.

**Speaker:** William DeMeo

**Session:** Algebra and Logic Seminar

**Location:**  
Department of Mathematics  
University of South Carolina  
LeConte College, Room 312

**Date:** Friday Oct 5, 3:30--4:30 PM

**Abstract:**
A long-standing open problem in universal algebra is to characterize those
lattices that are isomorphic to congruence lattices of fi nite algebras. It has
been shown that this problem is equivalent to the problem of characterizing
those lattices that are intervals in subgroup lattices of finite groups. In the
last two meetings, I gave an overview of some of our new results related to this
problem. Specifically, we discussed ways to expand and extend a finite algebra
so that its congruence lattice grows in predictable ways. We also discussed
"interval enforceable" properties of finite groups and how they might help us
solve the main problem. In this week's seminar, I will discuss these topics in
greater detail and supply proofs of many of the claims I've made in our previous
two meetings.

## Part 4: Oct 12, 2012  

**Title:** The Finite Lattice Representation Problem: Part iv.

**Speaker:** William DeMeo

**Session:** Algebra and Logic Seminar

**Location:**  
Department of Mathematics  
University of South Carolina  
LeConte College, Room 312

**Date:** Friday Oct 12, 3:30--4:30 PM

**Abstract:**
A long-standing open problem in universal algebra is to characterize those
lattices that are isomorphic to congruence lattices of finite algebras. This
week, I will conclude this series of lectures on this topic by discussing in
greater detail our new method for expanding and extending a finite algebra so
that its congruence lattice grows in predictable ways. In particular, I will
prove two basic theorems about such expansions, and demonstrate these results
with some examples using the Universal Algebra Calculator.
