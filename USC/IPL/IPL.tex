\metadata{IPL Notes}{Feb 28, 2014}
\begin{document}
This note summarizes the rules of inference for \ac{IPL} as I understand them.
This is based on the lectures given by Professor Robert Harper in September
2013 at CMU~\cite{Harper2012}. 
Notes for Harper's lectures were transcribed by his students and
this summary is based on the recorded lectures and the notes. 

As advanced by Per Martin-L\"{o}f, a modern presentation of \ac{IPL}
distinguishes the notions of \vocab{judgment} and \vocab{proposition}. A
judgment is something that may be known, whereas a proposition is something that
sensibly may be the subject of a judgment. For instance, the statement ``Every
natural number larger than $1$ is either prime or can be uniquely factored into
a product of primes\@.'' is a proposition because it sensibly may be subject to
judgment. That the statement is in fact true is a judgment.
Only with a proof, however, is it evident that the judgment indeed holds.

Thus, in \ac{IPL}, the two most basic judgments are $A \prop$ and $A \true$:
\begin{alignat*}{2}
  A \prop &&\quad& \text{$A$ is a well-formed proposition} \\
  A \true &&& \text{\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}l@{}}
                Proposition $A$ is intuitionistically true, i.e., has a proof.
              \end{tabular}}
\end{alignat*}
The inference rules for the $\prop$ judgment are called \vocab{formation rules}.
The inference rules for the $\true$ judgment are divided into classes:
\vocab{introduction rules} and \vocab{elimination rules}. 

The meaning of a proposition $A$ is given by the introduction rules for the
judgment $A \true$. The elimination rules are dual and  describe what may be
deduced from a proof of $A \true$.  The principle of \vocab{internal coherence},
also known as \emph{Gentzen's principle of inversion}, is that the introduction
and elimination rules for a proposition $A$ fit together properly.  The
elimination rules should be strong enough to deduce all information that was
used to introduce $A$ (\vocab{local completeness}), but not so strong as to
deduce information that might not have been used to introduce $A$ (\vocab{local
  soundness}).

\begin{center}
CONJUNCTION
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(formation)] 
If $A$ and $B$ are well-formed propositions, then so is
their \emph{conjunction}, which we write as $A \conj B$.
\begin{equation*}
  \infer[{\conj}\mathsf{F}]{A \conj B \prop}{
    A \prop & B \prop}
\end{equation*}

\item[(introduction)]
%\paragraph{Introduction.}
To give meaning to conjunction, we must say how
to introduce the judgment $A \conj B \true$.
A verification of $A \conj B$ requires a proof of $A$ and
a proof of $B$.
\begin{equation*}
  \infer[{\conj}\mathsf{I}]{A \conj B \true}{
    A \true & B \true}
\end{equation*}

\item[(elimination)]
%\paragraph{Elimination.}
Because every proof of $A \conj B$ comes from a pair of proofs, one of $A$ and
one of $B$, we are justified in deducing $A \true$ and $B \true$ from a proof of
$A \conj B$: 
\begin{mathpar}
  \infer[{\conj}\mathsf{E}_1]{A \true}{
    A \conj B \true}
  \and
  \infer[{\conj}\mathsf{E}_2]{B \true}{
    A \conj B \true}
\end{mathpar}
\end{itemize}

%\newpage
\begin{center}
TRUTH
 \end{center}
%We denote by $\truth$ the \emph{trivially true} proposition. 
\begin{itemize}
\item[(formation)]
The formation rule serves as immediate evidence for the judgment that $\truth$ is a
well-formed proposition.
\begin{equation*}
  \infer[{\truth}\mathsf{F}]{\truth \prop}{
    }
\end{equation*}

\item[(introduction)]
Since $\truth$ is a trivially true proposition, its introduction rule makes the
judgment $\truth \true$ immediately evident.

\begin{equation*}
  \infer[{\truth}\mathsf{I}]{\truth \true}{
    }
\end{equation*}

\item[(elimination)]
Since $\truth$ is trivially true, an elimination rule should not increase
our knowledge---we put in no information when we introduced $\truth \true$, so,
by the principle of conservation of proof, we should get no information out. Thus,
there is no elimination rule for $\truth$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
ENTAILMENT
 \end{center}
\emph{Entailment} is a judgment and is written as 
\begin{equation*}
  A_1 \true, \dotsc, A_n \true \entails A \true
\end{equation*}
This expresses the judgment that $A \true$ follows from 
$A_1 \true, \dotsc, A_n \true$. 
One can view $A_1 \true, \dotsc, A_n \true$ as being assumptions from which
the conclusion $A \true$ may be deduced. 
We assume that the entailment judgment satisfies several \emph{structural
  properties}: reflexivity, transitivity, weakening, contraction, and
permutation. 
\begin{itemize}
\item[Reflexivity:] An assumption is enough to conclude the same judgment.
\begin{equation*}
  \infer[\text{\textsf{R}}]{A \true \entails A \true}{
    }
\end{equation*}

\item[Transitivity:]
If you prove $A \true$, then you are justified in using it in a proof.
\begin{equation*}
  \infer[\text{\textsf{T}}]{C \true}{
    A \true &
    A \true \entails C \true}
\end{equation*}

Reflexivity and transitivity are undeniable since without them it would be
unclear what is meant by an \emph{assumption}.  An assumption should be strong enough
to prove conclusions (reflexivity), and only as strong as the proofs they stand for
(transitivity). 
The remaining structural properties---weakening, contraction, and
permutation---could be denied.  Logics that deny any of these properties are
called \emph{substructural logics}. 

\item[Weakening:]
We can add assumptions to a proof without invalidating that proof.
\begin{equation*}
  \infer[\text{\textsf{W}}]{B \true \entails A \true}{
    A \true}
\end{equation*}
\item[Contraction:]
The number of copies of an assumption does not matter.
\begin{equation*}
  \infer[\text{\textsf{C}}]{A \true \entails C \true}{
    A \true, A \true \entails C \true}
\end{equation*}
\item[Permutation:]
aka ``exchange;'' the order of assumptions does not matter.
\begin{equation*}
  \infer[\text{\textsf{P}}]{\pi(\ctx) \entails C \true}{
    \ctx \entails C \true}
\end{equation*}
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
IMPLICATION
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(formation)] 
\begin{equation*}
  \infer[{\imp}\mathsf{F}]{A \imp B \prop}{
    A \prop & B \prop}
\end{equation*}
\item[(introduction)]
\begin{equation*}
  \infer[{\imp}\mathsf{I}]{A \imp B \true}{
    A \true \entails B \true}
\end{equation*}
In this way, implication internalizes the entailment judgment as a proposition,
while we nonetheless maintain the distinction between propositions and
judgments.
%% (As an aside for those familiar with category theory, the relationship between
%% entailment and implication is analogous to the relationship between a mapping
%% and a collection of mappings internalized as an object in some category.) 
\item[(elimination)]
\begin{equation*}
  \infer[{\imp}\mathsf{E}]{B \true}{
    A \imp B \true & A \true} \,.
\end{equation*}
This rule is sometimes referred to as \latin{modus ponens}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
DISJUNCTION
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(formation)]
\begin{equation*}
  \infer[{\disj}\mathsf{F}]{A \disj B \prop}{
    A \prop & B \prop}
\end{equation*}
\item[(introduction)]
\begin{mathpar}
  \infer[{\disj}\mathsf{I_1}]{A \disj B \true}{
    A \true}
  \and
  \infer[{\disj}\mathsf{I_2}]{A \disj B \true}{
    B \true}
\end{mathpar}
\item[(elimination)]
\begin{equation*}
  \infer[{\disj}\mathsf{E}]{C \true}{
    A \disj B \true &
    A \true \entails C \true & B \true \entails C \true}
\end{equation*}
\end{itemize}

\medskip 

\hrule
\begin{center}
FALSEHOOD
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(formation)]
The unit of disjunction is falsehood, the proposition that is trivially never
true, which we write as $\falsehood$.  Its formation rule is immediate evidence
that $\falsehood$ is a well-formed proposition. 
\begin{equation*}
  \infer[{\falsehood}\mathsf{F}]{\falsehood \prop}{
    }
\end{equation*}
\item[(introduction)]
Because $\falsehood$ should never be true, it has no introduction rule.
\item[(elimination)]
\begin{equation*}
  \infer[{\falsehood}\mathsf{E}]{C \true}{
    \falsehood \true}
\end{equation*}
The elimination rule captures \latin{ex falso quodlibet}: from a proof of $\falsehood \true$, we may deduce that \emph{any} proposition $C$ is true because there is ultimately no way to introduce $\falsehood \true$.
Once again, the rules cohere.
The elimination rule is very strong, but remains justified due to the absence of any introduction rule for falsehood.
