Title: A Tutorial Introduction to the Lean Prover: Part 1

Abstract: The first in a two-part series on the Lean proof assistant,
this lecture introduces the mathematics of functional programming,
namely, the lambda calculus.  The second lecture will give a basic
introduction to Lean, a relatively new addition to the growing family
of functional programming languages.  Lean improves upon earlier proof
assistants by making it more natural and less painful to formalize
mathematical proofs.
