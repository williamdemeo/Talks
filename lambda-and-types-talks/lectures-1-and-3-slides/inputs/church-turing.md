- <p>In 1929-1932 <a class="highlight-blue">**Alonzo Church**</a>
  developed a formal system for 
  mathematical logic and computation called
  <a class="highlight-blue">**the $\lambda$-Calculus**.</a>

- <p>
  In 1935 he argued that any 
  <a class="highlight-green">*effectively computable*</a>
  function on the natural numbers can be computed in his calculus.

- <p>
    Independently in 1935 <a class="highlight-blue">**Alan Turing**</a> 
    developed what is now called the 
    <a class="highlight-blue">**Turing Machine**.</a>

- <p>
    In 1936 he too argued that any function on the natural
    numbers can be computed with his machine.

- <p>
    He also showed the two models are equivalent. 
    The equivalence was a powerful indication of the *universality* of 
    the models, and lead to what is now called the: *Church-Turing Thesis*
