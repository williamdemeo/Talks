   {}A {\bf finite algebra} is an utterly fundamental object in mathematics.  The shape
   of an algebra's {\bf \mbox{congruence lattice}} gives us vital information about
   the algebra.  
  \vspace{0.3em}

   However, we still don't know whether there are any restrictions on
   the possible shapes of congruence lattices.  Mathematicians have been on a
   quest for over 50 years to either find such restrictions or prove that none exist.

   {}We have identified large classes of lattices which occur as congruence
   lattices of finite algebras, and have found ways to build new
   ``representable'' lattices out of old ones.  Thus, we have made significant progress 
   toward a possible answer to this basic question:
  \vspace{0.3em}

   ``Is there a finite lattice which cannot be the congruence lattice of a
   finite algebra?''

{}An {\bf algebra} $\<A; F\>$ is a set $A$ together with a collection
$F$ of operations on the set.

\vspace{0.3em}

{\bf Example:} The set of integers 
\[A = \{\dots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \dots\}\]
along with the operations $F = \{+, -, \times\}$.

{}{\bf Gr\"{a}zter \& Schmidt}~\cite{GratzerSchmidt:1963} proved that there is no
restriction on the shape of a congruence lattice of an \emph{infinite} algebra.
So, if (as most suspect) there is a lattice which is not the congruence lattice
of a \emph{finite} algebra, this will reveal an important distinction between
finite vs.~infinite.

{\bf Kurzweil}~\cite{Kurzweil:1985} proved that if $L$ is a congruence lattice of a finite
algebra, then so is the {\it dual} of $L$ (i.e.~$L$ ``up-side-down'').

{\bf A Galois Correspondence}
\end{center}
For any finite lattice $L$, there is a finite set $A$ such that $L$ can be
embedded into the lattices of all partitions of $A$.  We can
then consider the set $F$ of all operations that respect the partitions of $L$.
If we're lucky, $L$ is the congruence lattice of the resulting algebra \algA.

\vspace{0.5em}

{\bf Nondensity Lemma:} {\it If $L$ is a union of a filter and an ideal, there will
always be nontrivial operations in $F$.}

The set of all congruences of an algebra forms the {\bf congruence lattice} of
the algebra, denoted $\bCon \bA$. 
Insight into the structure of $\bA$ is gained by knowing the shape of
$\bCon \bA$.
