annote={{\bf Abstract:} The classical Fourier transform is one of the most widely used mathematical
                  tools in engineering. However, few engineers know that
                  extensions of harmonic analysis to functions on groups holds
                  great potential for solving problems in robotics, image
                  analysis, mechanics, and other areas. For those that may be
                  aware of its potential value, there is still no place they can
                  turn to for a clear presentation of the background they need
                  to apply the concept to engineering problems. Engineering
                  Applications of Noncommutative Harmonic Analysis brings this
                  powerful tool to the engineering world. Written specifically
                  for engineers and computer scientists, it offers a practical
                  treatment of harmonic analysis in the context of particular
                  Lie groups (rotation and Euclidean motion). It presents only a
                  limited number of proofs, focusing instead on providing a
                  review of the fundamental mathematical results unknown to most
                  engineers and detailed discussions of specific
                  applications.Advances in pure mathematics can lead to very
                  tangible advances in engineering, but only if they are
                  available and accessible to engineers. Engineering
                  Applications of Noncommutative Harmonic Analysis provides the
                  means for adding this valuable and effective technique to the
                  engineer's toolbox.}

title={Geometric algebra: a computational framework for geometrical applications},
author={L. Dorst and S. Mann},
journal=CGA,
year=2002,
annote={{\bf Abstract:} Geometric algebra is a consistent computational
                  framework in which to define geometric primitives and their
                  relationships. This algebraic approach contains all geometric
                  operators and permits specification of constructions in a
                  coordinate-free manner. Thus, the ideas of geometric algebra
                  are important for developers of CAD systems. This paper gives
                  an introduction to the elements of geometric algebra, which
                  contains primitives of any dimensionality (rather than just
                  vectors), and an introduction to three of the products of
                  geometric algebra, the geometric product, the inner product,
                  and the outer product. These products are illustrated by using
                  them to solve simple geometric problems.\\

                  tool for solving problems in computer science, engineering,
                  physics, and mathematics. The articles in this volume, written
                  by experts in various fields, reflect an interdisciplinary
                  approach to the subject, and highlight a range of techniques
                  and applications. Relevant ideas are introduced in a
                  self-contained manner and only a knowledge of linear algebra
                  and calculus is assumed. Features and Topics: The
                  mathematical foundations of geometric algebra are explored;
                  Applications in computational geometry include models of
                  reflection and ray-tracing and a new and concise
                  characterization of the crystallographic groups; Applications
                  in engineering include robotics, image geometry, control-pose
                  estimation, inverse kinematics and dynamics, control and
                  visual navigation; Applications in physics include rigid-body
                  dynamics, elasticity, and electromagnetism; Chapters
                  dedicated to quantum information theory dealing with
                  multi-particle entanglement, MRI, and relativistic
                  generalizations Practitioners, professionals, and researchers
                  working in computer science, engineering, physics, and
                  mathematics will find a wide range of useful applications in
                  this state-of-the-art survey and reference book. Additionally,
                  advanced graduate students interested in geometric algebra
                  will find the most current applications and methods
                  discussed. }

  volume =     {21},

annote={{\bf Abstract:} In this paper we address the topics of scale-space and phase-based image
processing in a unifying framework. In contrast to the common opinion, the
Gaussian kernel is not the unique choice for a linear scale-space. Instead, we
chose the Poisson kernel since it is closely related to the monogenic signal, a
2D generalization of the analytic signal, where the Riesz transform replaces the
Hilbert transform. The Riesz transform itself yields the flux of the Poisson
scalespace and the combination of flux and scale-space, the monogenic
scale-space, provides the local features attenuation and phase-vector in
scale-space. Under certain assumptions, the latter two again form a monogenic
scale-space which gives deeper insight to low-level image processing. In
particular, we discuss edge detection by a new approach to phase congruency and
its relation to amplitude based methods, reconstruction from local amplitude and
local phase, and the evaluation of the local frequency.\\

                  an algorithmic approach to deal with the 2D-3D pose estimation
                  problem for free-form surface models. This work is an
                  extension to earlier studies presented in [29]. The discussion
                  of 1D contour models in [29] is extended to 2D free-form
                  surface models. We use a parametric representation of surfaces
                  and apply Fourier transformations to gain low-pass
                  descriptions of objects. We present an algorithm for pose
                  estimation, which uses the silhouette of the object as
                  pictorial information and recovers the 3D pose of the object
                  even for changing aspects of the object during image
                  sequences. We further present extensions to couple surface and
                  contour information on objects and show the potential of our
                  chosen approach for complex objects and scenes.\\

The technique we use to analyse the 3-dimensional transformations involved will be
that of geometric algebra: a framework based on the algebras of Clifford and Grassmann. This is
not a system designed specifically for the task in hand, but rather a framework for all mathematical
physics. Central to the power of this approach is the way in which the formalism deals with rotations; for
example, if we have two arbitrary sets of vectors, known to be related via a 3-D rotation, the rotation
is easily recoverable if the vectors are given. Extracting the rotation by conventional means is not as
straightforward. The calculus associated with geometric algebra is particularly powerful, enabling one, in a
very natural way, to take derivatives with respect to any multivector (general element of the algebra).
What this means in practice is that we can minimize with respect to rotors representing rotations,
vectors...\\

annote = {{\bf Abstract:} Abelian group DSP can be completely described in terms of a special class of
                  signals, the characters, defined by their relationship to the
                  translations defined by abelian group multiplication. The  rst
                  problem to be faced in extending classical DSP theory is to
                  decide on what is meant by a translation. We have selected
                  certain classes of nonabelian groups and defined translations
                  in terms of left nonabelian group multiplications. The main
                  distinction between abelian and nonabelian group DSP centers
                  around the problem of character extensions. For abelian groups
                  the solution of the character extension problem is
                  simple. Every character of a subgroup of an abelian group A
                  extends to a character of A. We will see that character
                  extensions lie at the heart of several fast Fourier transform
                  (FFT) algorithms. The nonabelian groups presented in this work
                  will be among the simplest generalizations of abelian
                  groups. A complete description of the DSP of an abelian by
                  abelian semidirect product will be given. For such a group G,
                  there exists an abelian normal subgroup A. A basis for signals
                  indexed by G can be constructed by extending the characters of
                  A and then by forming certain (left-) translations of these
                  characters. The crucial point is that some of these characters
                  of A cannot be extended to characters of G, but only to proper
                  subgroups of G. In contrast to abelian group DSP expansions,
                  expansions in nonabelian group DSP re ect local signal domain
                  information over these proper subgroups. These expansions can
                  be viewed as combined, local image-spectral image domain
                  expansions in analogy to time-frequency expansions. This DSP
                  leads to the definition of a certain class of group filters
                  whose properties will be explored on simulated and recorded
                  images. Through examples we will compare nonabelian group
                  filters with classical abelian group  filters. The main
                  observation is that in contrast to abelian group  filters,
                  nonabelian group  filters can localize in the image domain. This
                  advantage has been used for detecting and localizing the
                  position of geometric objects in image data sets. The works of
                  R. Holmes M. Karpovski and E. Trachtenberg are the basis of
                  much of the research in the application of nonabelian group 
                  harmonic analysis to DSP, especially in the construction of group transforms and
                  group filters. Similar ideas in coding theory have been
                  introduced by F. J. MacWilliams. During the last ten years
                  considerable effort has taken place to extend the range of applicability of nonabelian group
                  methods to the design of new  filters and spectral analysis
                  methodologies, as an image processing tool. Accompanying these
                  application efforts, there has been extensive development of
                  algorithms for computing Fourier transforms over nonabelian
                  groups generalizing the classical FFT. \\

Title={Group Filters and Image Processing},

description = {{\bf Abstract:} The translation-invariance of most classical signal processing transforms and
                  filtering operations is largely responsible for their
                  widespread use. Translation-invariance is crucial for
                  interpreting the results of filtering operations and for
                  efficiently implementing these operations. The usual approach
                  in DSP is to define a transform and then show that it is shift
                  or translation invariant. In this work, the translations are
                  viewed as the primary source of classical DSP operations
                  including convolution and Fourier representation. Once this
                  primacy is established, it is reasonable to ask if there are
                  other collections of index set mappings yielding a new DSP and
                  if this new DSP has applications. This text shows that this is
                  the case. 

                  By combining digital signal processing with group harmonic
                  analysis, the authors provide a framework for extending the
                  collection of translations. The specific translations defined
                  in this work through examples and illustrations are
                  sufficiently broad to include many important applications in
                  signal/image processing, biology and physics.  

                  Starting with a complete treatment of abelian group harmonic
                  analysis, this text develops a unifying conceptual basis for
                  both abelian and nonabelian group harmonic
                  analysis. Throughout the text, the common ground in various
                  cases is presented in a common language and format, and
                  emphasizes more clearly and distinctly the differences when
                  they occur. Based on the DSP developed relative to groups,
                  group filters are defined and compared. The main result is
                  that in contrast to abelian group filters, nonabelian group
                  filters localize in the image domain. A detailed account is
                  given to show that expansions over nonabelian group harmonic
                  analysis can be viewed as combined, local image-spectral image
                  domain expansions analogous to time-frequency expansions. 

                  A chapter is devoted to illustrating the use of the
                  localization property for detecting and localizing the
                  position of geometric objects in image data sets by
                  straightforward matched-filtering operation. 

                  The results in this work stand alone in the sense that they
                  are self-contained but it will be an invaluable addition to
                  the larger field of digital signal and image processing.},

annote={{\bf Abstract:}
It is generally believed that the power of unit root tests is determined only by the time span of observations,
not by their sampling frequency. We show that the sampling frequency does matter for financial time series
displaying fat tails and volatility clustering. Our claim builds on recent work on unit root testing based on
non-Gaussian GARCH-based likelihood functions. Such methods yield power gains in the presence of fat
tails and volatility clustering, and the strength of these features increases with the sampling frequency. This
is illustrated using Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application to real exchange rates.},

We  derive low  frequency, say  weekly, models  implied by  high  frequency, say  daily, 
ARMA  models with  symmetric GARCH errors. Both  stock  and  flow  variable cases  are 
considered. We  show that low  frequency models exhibit conditional heteroskedasticity of 
the  GARCH form as well. The  parameters in  the  conditional variance equation of  the  low 
frequency model  depend  upon  mean,  variance, and  kurtosis parameters of  the  
corresponding high frequency model. Moreover, strongly consistent estimators of  the  
parameters  in  the  high  frequency model  can  be  derived  from  low  frequency data  in  many 
interesting cases. The  common assumption in  applications that  rescaled innovations are 
independent is  disputable, since it  depends upon  the  available data  frequency.

This  paper  studies  the  random  walk,  in  a  general  time  series  setting  that  allows  for 
weakly  dependent  and  heterogeneously  distributed  innovations.  It  is  shown  that  simple 
least  squares  regression  consistently  estimates  a  unit  root  under  very  general  conditions  in 
spite  of  the  presence  of  autocorrelated  errors. The  limiting  distribution  of  the  standardized 
estimator  and  the  associated  regression  t  statistic  are  found  using  functional  central  limit 
theory.  New  tests  of  the  random  walk  hypothesis  are  developed  which  permit  a  wide  class 
of  dependent  and  heterogeneous  innovation  sequences.  A  new  limiting  distribution  theory 
is  constructed  based  on  the  concept  of  continuous  data  recording.  This  theory,  together 
with  an  asymptotic  expansion  that  is  developed  in  the  paper  for  the  unit  root  case,  explain

year={2001},
pages={473--498},
publisher={The Econometric Society},
annote={{\bf Abstract:}
    The PPP puzzle is based on empirical evidence that international price differences for
individual goods (LOOP) or baskets of goods (PPP) appear highly persistent or even
nonstationary. The present consensus is these price differences have a half-life that is of
the order of five years at best, and infinity at worst. This seems unreasonable in a world
where transportation and transaction costs appear so low as to encourage arbitrage and
the convergence of price gaps over much shorter horizons, typically days or weeks.
However, current empirics rely on a particular choice of methodology, involving (i)
relatively low-frequency monthly, quarterly, or annual data, and (ii) a linear model
specification. In fact, these methodological choices are not innocent, and they can be
shown to bias analysis towards findings of slow convergence and a random walk. 
Intuitively, if we suspect that the actual adjustment horizon is of the order of days, then
monthly and annual data cannot be expected to reveal it. If we suspect arbitrage costs are
high enough to produce a substantial "band of inaction," then a linear model will fail to
support convergence if the process spends considerable time random-walking in that
band. Thus, when testing for PPP or LOOP, model specification and data sampling should
not proceed without consideration of the actual institutional context and logistical
framework of markets.},
