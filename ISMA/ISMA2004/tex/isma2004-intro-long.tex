\ismasec{Introduction}
The translation-invariance of most classical signal
processing transforms and filtering operations is largely
responsible for their widespread use, and is crucial for
efficient algorithmic implementation and interpretation 
of results \cite{An:2003}. 

%Underlying most digital signal 
%processing (DSP) algorithms is the group $\Z/N$ of integers 
%modulo $N$, which serves as the data indexing set.  
%Translations are defined using addition modulo $N$, and 
%basic operations, including convolutions and Fourier 
%expansions, are developed relative to these translations. 

DSP on \emph{finite abelian groups} such as $\Z/N$ is
well understood and has great practical utility.  An
excellent treatment that is applications-oriented, while
remaining fairly abstract and general, is provided by 
%\citeN{Tolimieri:1998}.
Tolimieri and An in \cite{Tolimieri:1998}.
Recently, however, interest in the practical utility of
\emph{finite nonabelian groups} has grown
significantly. Although the theoretical foundations of
nonabelian groups are well established, applications of the
theory to DSP have yet to  become common-place;
cf.~\cite{Byrnes:2004} (the NATO
ASI ``Computational Non-commutative Algebras,'' Italy,
2003). Another notable exception is \cite{An:2003},
which develops theory and algorithms for
indexing data with nonabelian groups, defining translations
with a non-commutative group multiply operation, and
performing typical DSP operations, such as convolution,
relative to these translations. 
%The work %of An and Tolimieri 
%demonstrates that including nonabelian groups among the
%possible data indexing strategies significantly broadens the
%range of useful signal processing techniques.

This paper describes the use of nonabelian groups
for indexing 1-dimensional signals, and discusses the
novel signal transformations and computational advantages
that result
% and insights to be gained 
from this approach. 
We examine a simple but instructive class of 
nonabelian groups -- the \emph{semidirect
product} groups -- and show that, when elements of such
groups are used to index the data, and standard DSP
operations are defined with respect to special group
binary operators, more general and interesting
signal transformations are possible.
%For a standard noise reduction problem, we show
%how the new framework simplifies the algorithm, while
%simultaneously generalizing it to handle more complex noise
%reduction tasks. Numerical results are provided along with
%the Matlab source code for reproducing them.
