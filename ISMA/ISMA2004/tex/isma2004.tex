\ismasec{Notation and Background}
%============================================================
This section summarizes the notations,
definitions, and important facts needed below.
The presentation style is terse since the goal %of this section 
is to distill from the %more general 
literature only those results that are most relevant for DSP
applications. 
The books~\cite{An:2003} and~\cite{Tolimieri:1998} treat the
same material in a more thorough and rigorous manner.

Throughout, $\C$ denotes complex numbers, 
$G$ an arbitrary (nonabelian) group, %of order $N$, 
and $\LG$ the collection of complex valued functions on $G$.

\ismasec{Nonabelian Group DSP}
%=======================================================================
This section presents some basic theory of digital 
signal processing (DSP), but relies on a more general 
mathematical formalism than that employed by the 
standard textbooks on the subject.\footnote{A few notable
  exceptions are 
  \cite{{An:2003}, {Tolimieri:1998}}, {Chirikjian:2002}.}

\ismasec{Examples}
%=======================================================================
As seen above, when varying group structures are placed on indexing sets,
and products in the resulting group algebra are computed, 
interesting signal transforms obtain.  In this section,
we elucidate the nature of these operations by
examining some simple concrete examples in detail.
