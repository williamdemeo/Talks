Title: What can we learn about a finite group from intervals in its subgroup lattice?
Abstract: We recently proposed classifying group properties according to whether
they can be imposed on a group G by assuming the subgroup lattice Sub(G)
contains an interval of a given shape.  Suppose P is a group property and suppose
there exists a lattice L such that if G is a group and L is isomorphic to an
interval [H,G] in Sub(G), with H core-free in G, then G has property P.  
We call such P a ``core-free interval enforceable'' (cf-IE) property. We show
how the study of such properties may help us solve an important long standing
open problem in universal algebra.   In the process, we will prove a useful
lemma about isomorphic intervals in subgroup lattices of finite groups which
generalizes the standard Noether isomorphism theorem.
