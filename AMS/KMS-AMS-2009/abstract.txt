Title: Some Remarks on the Finite Lattice Representation Problem

Abstract:

A well-known result of universal algebra states: every algebraic lattice is isomorphic
to the congruence lattice of an algebra.  It is natural to ask whether every finite 
lattice occurs as the congruence lattice of a \emph{finite} algebra. This fundamental
question, asked over 40 years ago, is among the most elusive problems of universal
algebra. 

Call a finite lattice L ``representable'' if it is the congruence lattice of a finite
algebra.  By Pudlak and Tuma (1980), one assumes the finite lattice is ``concretely
represented'' as a sublattice of Eq(X), the equivalences of a finite set X. We define
a closure operator on Eq(X) with the useful property that a sublattice of Eq(X) is
a congruence lattice of an algebra on X if and only if it is closed. Certain closed
lattices are ``hereditary,'' meaning all sublattices are also closed, while others
have the property that their closure is all of Eq(X).  J.B. Nation calls the latter
``superbad.''  

This concrete approach yields new insights.  In particular, we prove: (1) All $M_n$
lattices have superbad representations; (2) A union of a proper ideal and proper
filter is never superbad; (3) All hexagons are hereditary.  These and other results,
including some examples of concrete representations, will be presented.
